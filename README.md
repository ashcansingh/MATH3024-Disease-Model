# Lockdown Disease Model

### Overview
This project is part of the **MATH3024** unit at the University of Western Australia, focusing on mathematical modeling for disease spread under varying lockdown conditions. The project explores an SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model adapted to include parameters for lockdown measures, providing insights into how lockdown timing and duration impact disease transmission.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
1. To model the spread of a disease using an SIR-based framework with added parameters for lockdown scenarios.
2. To analyze how different lockdown strategies affect the infection curve.
3. To provide a tool for visualizing the potential impact of public health measures on disease dynamics.

### Features
- **SIR Model with Lockdown Adjustment**: Extends the classic SIR model to simulate lockdown scenarios, allowing users to modify parameters such as lockdown duration and intensity.
- **Parameter Adjustability**: Users can change infection and recovery rates, as well as lockdown factors, to explore different scenarios.
- **Visualization**: Generates plots to visualize the number of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals over time, with clear indicators of when lockdown measures are applied.
